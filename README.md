- Geo: mine and collect stone materials
- Fig: assemble and tinker with components
- Recur: process stone materials into charges and components

1.  Circle: water / poison
2.  Octagon: snow
3.  Parallelogram: grass
4.  Square: rock / ground
5.  Triangle: fire
6.  Rhombus: electric

Note (aesthetic): fill / stroke

Note:
- Force type can manifest any elemental type
- Normal type can assume form and abilities of any type other than ghost or psychic, and is thus resistant to all damage except ghost and psychic

**How do types affect one another?**
Water
- strengthened by:
- immune to:
- resistant to:
- weakened by:
- threatened by:

Poison

Snow

Grass

Rock

Ground

Fire

Electric

Force

Psychic

Ghost

Mythic

Normal

### Alignment
- Light: defense and healing
- Dark: attack and affliction

### Rarity
- Standard 70%
- Sweet 25%
- Shiny 5%
- Legendary = 1

### Levels
**Note**: Levels were used in pokemon to calculate attack damage and for each level gained, a pokemon's stats would rise. However, if training is about expertise, what should increase with level is not the attack or defense, but the accuracy of attacks and resistence of defenses. Since alignment involves healing and afflictions, there maybe should be no change between levels. However, for instance, how much stamina / health  is restored or affected by healing or afflictions, should likely not deviate.

This brings up another point: Is health / stamina equivalent between creatures and their levels? Equivalence can apply with percentages.

**Starter**
- Newborn: 1
  Grows to 5
- Undertown: 5
  +5 each area/town

**Max**: 100
- Mastery at 101: full control of stat affects
- Mastery at 102: full control of cond. affects

Note: Mastery may not be a feature anymore, rather level may equate to accuracy and resistance.
- consider: area effects and conditions

### Evolutions
**Note**: In pokemon, creatures level up and at certain levels, they evolve into a more enhanced variation. Pokemon also learn moves as they level up, often increasing their efficacy in battle. If there is no affect on physical stats for leveling, what is the effect of evolving?
- Does rarity also constitute variants?

**Options**:
1.  Clone geos
    Temple: charge + geo
2.  Merge geos
    Temple: geo + geo
    Level = max(geo, geo)
    Geo of temple type (or 1st) = dominant sire
3.  Evolve at level

### Towns
Identity:
- type (shape, element)
- math. prefs (architecture)
- resources (raw, processed)
- knowledge (skills, arts, world)
- religion (values, beliefs)
- culture (expressions, rules, expectations)

Places in every town
- Market / Shops
- Clinic
- (opt) Community hub
- Temple
- Residences

Temple
1. Harvest charges
2. Visit religious order
3. Clone, merge, or heal geos

Corresponds to types defining creature class, culture and area of origin. Instead of elements, types are based on shapes. However, for battle and interaction, the way the types react to one another is partially based on the elements they’re associated with.

Graphics based on math. concepts
- Operations
- Impossible objects
- Symmetry: one half reflects other half
- Reflection: one shape reflected over axis
- Lines of perspective
- Truncation: replace edge/vertex of 2d/3d shape with face/edge
- Stellation: extend edge of shape to touch shape at another edge or vertex
- Hyperbolic
- Tessellation: tiling

### Care system
**Language:**
- simple, generic concepts
- questions, statements and demands
- emotional expression
- priority
- memory, perception and conclusions
- intensity

**Lexicon:**
- types, shapes, styles (math. concepts)
- geos, figs, recurs
- cities
- roles
- skills
- actions
- values
